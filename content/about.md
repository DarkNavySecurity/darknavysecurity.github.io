We are DARKNAVY, an INDEPENDENT and FREE-SPIRITED security research team and service provider. We established AVSS (
Adversarial Vulnerability Scoring System) to evaluate vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of system mitigation
mechanisms in real adversarial environments.

During the past 20 years, we have been at the forefront of cybersecurity research and application, having won multiple
world
championships. We established the worldâ€™s unique and top-class security geek competition GEEKCON and responsibly
disclosed over 1000 severe vulnerabilities. With relentless efforts, we helped over 100 companies around the world to
address security issues, facilitating the growth of the cybersecurity industry.

Our gaol is to make a more secure digital world by eliminating vulnerabilities in IT products / services. By sharing our
knowledge through consulting and R&D experiences, we hope to enable organizations to better prepare and protect
themselves against the ever-evolving threat of cyber-attacks, and empower the development of the global security
community.
