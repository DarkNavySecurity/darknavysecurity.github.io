We are DARKNAVY, an independent and free-spirited security research team and service provider. We have established AVSS (Adversarial Vulnerability Scoring System) to evaluate vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of system mitigation mechanisms in real adversarial environments.

Over the past 20 years, we have been at the forefront of cybersecurity research and application, winning multiple world championships. We have also established GEEKCON, a unique and top-class security geek competition, and responsibly disclosed over 1000 severe vulnerabilities. With relentless efforts, we have helped over 100 companies worldwide address security issues, contributing to the growth of the cybersecurity industry.

Our goal is to create a more secure digital world by eliminating vulnerabilities in IT products/services. By sharing our knowledge through consulting and R&D experiences, we aim to enable organizations to better prepare and protect themselves against the ever-evolving threat of cyber attacks.

We also strive to empower the development of the global security community by bringing together global leading experts, top researchers, white-hat hackers, academics, policymakers, practitioners and solution providers to share knowledge of frontier technology achievements, inspire awareness, insights and innovative solutions of current and emerging cyber threats and trends.
